## Text Summarization
### [With Transformers](https://github.com/Dipankar-Medhi/nlpLand/tree/main/text_summarization/text-summarization-transformers)



```
Input Text: 
Around 65% (2.37 lakh) of all road accidents in India took place on 
straight roads in 2020, government data has shown. 
Such accidents killed over 85,000 people, 
the 'Road accidents in India- 2020' report released by the
government this year, said. 
Over 72% of accidents and 67% of fatalities took place under sunny 
or clear weather in 2020, it added.

Summarized text: 
65% (2.37 lakh) of all road accidents in India  took place on 
straight roads in 2020 . Such accidents killed over 85,000 people, 
government data shows .

```


**Model**:
```python

model_name = "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"
model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

result = summarizer2(text, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)

```

### [With Simplet5](https://github.com/Dipankar-Medhi/nlpLand/blob/main/text_summarization/text-summarization-transformers/text-summarization-T5.ipynb)

```
Input text:
At least six people died and 71 others were hospitalised in the 
last three days due to diarrhoea after allegedly drinking 
contaminated water from open sources in several villages in 
Odisha's Rayagada district, officials said on Saturday. A team of 
11 doctors visited the affected villages and collected water and 
blood samples and sent those for examination.

Summarized text:
6 dead, 71 others hospitalised after drinking contaminated water
```

**Model**
```python
model.from_pretrained(model_type='t5', model_name='t5-base')
```

### [Using spaCy](https://github.com/Dipankar-Medhi/nlpLand/tree/main/text_summarization/text-summarization-spacy)

```
Input sentence:
Whilst the crypto markets have taken a pretty public downturn of
 late, this is a great time to experiment and build your own web3 
 projects. Ether, and almost all other cryptocurrencies, are 
 cheaper to get your hands on, gas fees (the transaction fees paid 
 when using blockchain networks) are much lower than their 2021 
 highs and now is your chance to learn a new skill that could be 
 very valuable going forward.

Output summary:
Ether, and almost all other cryptocurrencies, are cheaper to get
 your hands on, gas fees (the transaction fees paid when using 
 blockchain networks) are much lower than their 2021 highs and now 
 is your chance to learn a new skill that could be very valuable 
 going forward., Whilst the crypto markets have taken a pretty 
 public downturn of late, this is a great time to experiment and 
 build your own web3 projects.
